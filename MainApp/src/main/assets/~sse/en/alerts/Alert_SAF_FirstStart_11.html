	<b>SAF Mode</b><br/>
	<ul>
		<li>Use this mode only for locations that are not accessible (or writable) in the standard way (using <img style="vertical-align: middle;" width="37px" height="20px" src="../../img/volumeListButton.png"/> button).</li>
		<li>SAF mode provides significantly lower performance and has some limitations.</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<h2>Notes & Limitations</h2>
	<span style="font-size: 80%;">
		<ul>
			<li>SAF API provides much lower performance than the standard direct file access mode (<span class="strokeYellow">especially with dirs that contain a lot of files/subdirs</span>).</li>
			<li>Home/Custom directories cannot be set in SAF; however, the last-picked SAF URI is automatically saved: <b>Home Button → Go to Last Picked SAF Dir</b>.</li>
			<li>The wipe feature does not work. If option “Wipe after Encryption” is checked in the app settings, file(s) will be deleted only.</li>
			<li>In general, <span class="strokeYellow">external SD cards are usually much less reliable</span> (especially some combinations of devices/SD cards) than an internal memory. Also, be sure to <b>always safely unmount SD cards</b> (and other external storages) before removing.</li>
		</ul>
	</span>
